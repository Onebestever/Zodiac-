### How It’s Made
The zodiac calendar was really fun to do  using the both comparison & logical  operators that compared two different values to not be exactly the same but similar & or lesser than or greater than. In this examples month & day were the values. Depending on the number of day & month it displayed your zodiac sign.


** Langs used **
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

### Lessons Learned
The lesson I learned was how powerful logical and comparison numerators are and how flexible they can be with creating Boolean functions.
